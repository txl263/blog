<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have built websites for clients and have held full time development jobs in IT as well.</p>

<p>I like creating software because I've always dreamed of being an inventor and solving problems.  Software lets me carry out that dream in a small way and perhaps someday in a big way.</p>
