<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I created <a href="txl263.github.io/blog" class="pink">spokt.com</a> </p>

<p>I like creating software because I've always dreamed of being an inventor and solving problems.  Software lets me carry out that dream in a small way and perhaps someday in a big way.</p>

<p>You may email me: txl263 [at!] 163 [dot!] com</p>
